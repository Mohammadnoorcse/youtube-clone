     comment:"This man saved my life. I prepared for two weeks straight by watching his videos and training every day. I got an overall score of 7 (L:8/W:6.5/R:7/S:7). I'd say the keys to passing this test are: practise and listen to Chris's advice. Also, on the day of the test, try to relax as much as possible, as stress will freeze your performance. Be confident, you can do it.",
